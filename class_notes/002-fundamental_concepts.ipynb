    "### **Confidentiality**\n",
    "\n",
    "*  Measures attackers ability to get unathorized data or access to information from app or system\n",
    "\n",
    "*  People may be authentic, but not authorized to view \n",
    "  \n",
    "*  Techniques, often cryptography to allow only approved users to view information\n",
    "\n",
    "*  Confidential information can include:\n",
    "    * passwords\n",
    "    * crypto keys\n",
    "    * PII\n",
    "    * PHI\n",
    "    * IP\n",
    "    * other sensitive info\n",
    "\n",
    "##### High-level confidentiality\n",
    "\n",
    "* Uses hybrid encryption of symmetric & asym \n",
    "\n",
    "* Post-quantum and homomorphic crypto\n",
    "\n",
    "* Compartmentalization \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Integrity**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Measures attacker's ability to manipulate, change, or remove data at rest or in transit\n",
    "\n",
    "     * Includes configurations  \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "* Involves implementation of controls allowing only authoirzed subjects have ability to modify information\n",
    "\n",
    "* Might also include affirming identity of communicating peer (origin authentication)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Breaches include injection or hijacking data in transit, modifyihng files, changing acls, dns & arp cache poisoning\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### High-level integrity\n",
    "\n",
    "Advanced goals of the Clark-Wilson model:\n",
    "\n",
    "* prevent unauthorized users from making modifications\n",
    "\n",
    "* separation of duties to prevent authorized users from making improper modifications\n",
    "\n",
    "* Ensure well-formed transactions; maintain internal and external consistency\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Availability**\n",
    "\n",
    "* measures attacker's ability to disrupt or prevent access to services or data \n",
    "\n",
    "* controls protect systems and services from spoofing, flooding, DDoS, poisonion, and other attacks that affect the ability to deliver data, content, and services\n",
    "\n",
    "* software, hardware, & resources can be affected by availability attacks\n",
    "    * bandwidth floods\n",
    "    * cpu spiking\n",
    "    * power consumption\n",

    "* availability zones in cloud service providers\n",
    "* regions spread throughout the world\n",

    "\n",
    "Opposite goals of CIA triad:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Disclosure - unauthorized revealing of data and information\n",
    "\n",
    "* Alteration - unathorized change of data or systems\n",

    "**Authenticity**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Authenticity refers to the accuracy and identity of the origin of the entity/data\n",
    "\n",
    "* often tied to identity\n",

    "\n",
    "* referred to control of physical or logical asset\n",
    "* breach of possession may not mean breach of confidentiality\n",
    "\n",
    "##### High-level Authenticity\n",
    "\n",
    "* origin auth is basic form of authentication\n",
    "\n",
    "    * only provide degree of confidence that the correct password, phrase, or keys were used  \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "* add'l levels of authentication rely on trusted third parties (i.e. certs, digital signatures, multi-factors)\n",
    "\n",
    "* kba - knowledged based authentication (i.e. have you ever lived at such and such an address)\n",
    "\n",

    "### **Non-repudiation**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Fifth Infosec pillar\n",
    "\n",
    "* Inability to refuse participation in a digital transaction, contract, or communication \n",
    "\n",
    "* aka provides proof someone did something, signed something, etc\n",
    "\n",
    "* level of assurance that owner of key pair used them, cannot convincingly deny use\n",
    "\n",
    "* responsibility of creator or owner to protect key\n",
    "\n",
    "* must notify when key is stolen, lost, or compromised\n",
    "\n",
    "* typially accomplished w/digital certificates\n",
