# Site and Facility Security

## **Defense in Depth Approach**

### Operational Physical Security

* ISC2 defines three categories of controls: managerial, operational and technical

* Physical security is an operational control

* Goal of physical security is to ensure safety and CIA of all resources in org from:

    * Environmental threats

    * Natural disasters

    * Man-made attacks

    * Supply system threats

    * Socio-political threats

### Primary and Secondary Loss

* Primary losses include: 

    * Loss of life

    * Interruption to operational

    * Productivity loss

    * Response time

    * Revenue

* Secondary losses include:

    * Compromised CIA of assets

    * Replacement costs

    * Damaged reputation

    * Customers or competitive advantage

    * Fines and judgements

* Secondary losses can often exceed primary in the long run - cascading loss that continues beyond initial loss

### Defense in depth 

* Begin at property or facility edge and work back to most valuable assets

* Or, begin at "the keep" and work out to edge

* Outward-in for this course

* Different sites will have varying demarcation points of physical & logical entry

## **Perimeter Security**

### Permieter Barriers

* Landscaping, hedge rows, brush, etc

* Fences of varying types

* Tire shredders

* Bollards

* Moats or ponds

* Gates

### Classes of Gates

* Class I: Residential

* Class II: Commercial, like parking lot or garage

* Class III: Industrial/limited access (warehouse, factory, loading dock, etc)

* Class IV: Restricted access operation, often requires supervisory control (prison, airport, etc)

### Fence Barriers

* May be used to protect certain zones

* High security will use barbed wire (inward or outward facing), electric, with warning signs every 6-8 feet

* Combined with entry/exit gates of varying strength

    * Barricade gates 

    * Wooden arms

    * Tire shredders

### Bollards

* Vertical posts in strategic areas to rpohibit vehicles from entry

* In front of buildings or lots, along sidewalks to guide pedestrians

* Usually strong metal or concrete

* High-tech bollards can be mechanical with cameras and sensors

* Can be vertical or horizontal

### Signage

* Deterrent control

* Signs & window stickers deter unauthorized activity and provide safety

* May be combined with harmful fences

* Logical system banner is also form of signage, but administrative/technical control rather than physical

## **Common Physical Security Controls**

### CCTV and Security Cameras

* Used for monitoring and record

* Considered detective control, but presence can be considered a deterrent

* Commonly recorded and sent to monitoring stations with guards or technicians

* Backup recorded media should be securely stored

* Should trigger alerts if disabled

* Should be combined with lighting and dead spots should be covered

### Lighting

* Visibility

* Internal and external systems

* Low lights for posts and patroling

* Glaring for lights for intruders - tripped or triggered, or on at all times

* Common types of protective lighting systems:

    * Continuous (most common)

    * Trip lighting - activated by trigger or sensor

    * Standby - activated when suspicious activity is suspected or in power outage

    * Emergency - limited in use

* Mercury Vapor

    * Least temperature sensitive

    * Preferred outdoor security lighting

    * Long life, strong illumination, slow turn on

* Sodium Vapor

    * Soft yellow light

    * More effective than mercury

    * Great in fog

* Quartz

    * Bright white light - high visibility

    * Immediately turns on

    * Ideal for perimeter & problem areas - 1500 to 2000 watts

* LED

    * Cost effective

    * Inexpensive and readily available

### Industrial Camouflage

* Cameras and surveillance are camouflaged in landscaping elements, statutes, and trees

* Ex - cell towers and other equipment covered by fake trees

* Some high-security rooms can be underground and set at distance from main builiding

### Security Guards

* Guards can be 24x7 or on site during business or off-hours only

* Multiple types of security control: detective, preventative, and deterrent

* Should provide rapid seurity response if an intrusion or incident occurs

* Should be able to work with law enforcement

* Considerations for security guards include:

    * Hire contracted, freelance, or certified/licensed

    * Armed or unarmed

    * Impact on insurance policies

    * Is company involved w/background & screening

    * Who provides ongoing training

### Robotic Sentries

* Used in home or commercial environments

* Equipped with cameras, sensors, and more

* Ex. Samsung SGR-A1, type of sentry gun developed with Korea University to support DMZ troops

### Motion Detection Sensors

* Photoelectric - break in light beam

* Passive IR - break in IR light

* Vibration

* Acoustic

* Microwave

* Electromechanical - break in electrical circuit

* Electrostatic

* Mositure and temperature detection

* Sensors trigger alarms

    * Static or flashing light on panel

    * Bell or horn > 130 db

    * SMS

    * Telephone or software alerts 

    * Slient alarms

### Locks

* Most common, considered preventative

* Only delay entry - but are a preventative control

* Cannot deter resolute attacks - locks can be bypassed, most keys easy to duplicate

* Physical, electronic, and/or biometric

* Types of locks include:

    * Key 

    * Warded - obstructions to keyhole that prevent wrongly cut keys from entering

    * Wafer/tumbler - wafers under spring tension at core or plug, protrude outside dimaeter of plug into shell formed by lock body

    * Deadbolt

    * Interchanable core

    * Combination

    * Electronic combination

    * Keyless - sequence of buttons - cipher lock

    * Smart lock - most hotels

### Breaking physical locks

* Picking

* Raking

* Brute force - always successful given enough time & effort

### Personnel controls

* Guest registration at desk

    * Log guest in register

    * Camera station for temp badge

* No piggybacking or tailgating policies

## **Power Controls**

* Power redundancy beneficial to disaster recovery 

* Power system security involves practices to keep systems operating when subcomponents fail

* Should operate systems so any single failure does not overload other components

* Enterprises should depoy redundant power, surge protection, UPS, and backup generators

* Junctions should be secured and have adequate lighting and cameras

### Blackout vs Brownout

* Blackout

    * complete loss of power for longer periods

    * Hours to days, weeks in serious emergencies or disasters

    * Can occur due to technical problem on grid, production sites, or transmission lines

* Brownout

    * Intentional or unintentional sag, slump, or drop in voltage

    * Can damage electrical devices, poor performance or go bad

    * Can occur due to environmental or disasters

* Hot spares and failover devices important to DR planning

## **HVAC and Environmental Controls**

* Poor HVAC = temperature extremes, humidity, or dryness problems

* Need proper monitoring & maintenance 

* Physical security of components

* Location may be limited by facility 

* Can also include possibility of chemical & biological leaks or attacks

### Hot and Cold Aisles

* Recommended 72 - 76 F, 40-60% humidity

* Hot and cold ailes to move hot air from devices and direct to AC

* HVAC shoud have separate controls for data center or server room

## **Distribution Frames and Wiring Closets**

* Gain visibility into all ethernet and fiber runs, as well as security of distribution rooms and closets

    * Under floor, above ceiling, in walls

* Lock all doors to server & distribution rooms

* Cameras along with other types of sensors and access alarms

* No window access, or use security windows with wire mesh

* Use hardened management stations & environmental controls for temp, fire, gas, and humidity

* Access, Distribution, and core closeting

## **Server Rooms and Data Centers**

* Know all ingress and egress points

* Implement rpotective barriers

* Redundant and monitored support systems

* Visibility into all power conduits & water/gas lines

* Visibility into high-security compartmentalized areas

* Work with facilities mgmt to integrate blueprints & topo maps 

* Control physical access at permieter and room ingress points

* Authorized staff should pass two-factor authentication min of two times to acess data center floors

* Biometric MFA highly recommended

* Visitors & contractors ID'd, signed in, and escorted continually

* Access revoked when access no longer needed, even if employment continues

* Automatic fire detection & suppression

* Electrical power fully redundant and maintainable w/o impact to operations 24/7

* UPS provides backup power for critical and essential loads

* Use generators to provide backup power for facility

* Airgap control network from regular network

* Separate highly secure networks from unsecured with physical or logical compartmentalization

* Log and audit all devices and objects entering & exiting facility

* Stop malicious & priv users from having individual access

## **Media and Evidence Storage Facilities**

### Secure Enclosures

* Corporate safe may be highest value asset based on contents

* Safes used to protect valuable items like currency, deeds, securities, policies, precious metals, cybercurrency cold storage, and failsafe passwords/break glass passwords

* Employees may need special area to store & protect valuables - i.e. lockers or locked cabinets

* Reinforced filing cabinet designed to withstand burglary attempts

* Goverment provides container classification based on time to break into them, either covertly or surreptitiously, with no forced entry

### Safes

* UL provides safe classifications based on withstanding attacks

    * ex. 30 minutes to break in using various tooles and torches - classified as Tool Resistant safe class TL30

* Factors considered in classification include:

    * Locking mechanisms

    * Materials of construction

    * Weight & whether anchored or embedded in concrete

    * Tensile strength of the steel

    * Presence of relocking device

### Media Storage Facilities

* Often stores data backups & redundant spares

* May include hard copies of documents and microfiches

* Should be part of COO and BCP

* Same access policies should apply as those to data center and other sensitive areas 

* AWS, GCP, Azure offer long-term data archiving and HSMs with AES 

* Should be covered with disposition and destruction policy

* Procedures should include decommissioning process to prevent data exposure

* NIST 800-88 (Guidelines for Media Sanitization) can be part of decomm process

### Evidence Storage

* Only as secure as honesty of staff

* Separation of duties and dual operator are helpful policies

* Same stringent security as data center

* Chain of custody must be maintained for incident response, forensics, and law enforcement

* Items in evidence rooms may have higher street value than typical media storage

* Walls should be made of cider block or concrete

* Walls should extend ceiling to floor, no over-wall access

* Doors should be solid, preferably steel with no glass

* Preferably no doors leading directly to exterior of building from evidence room

* Modern digital evidence software can be used

## **Restricted and Work Area Security**

### Mantraps

* System that routes personnel through two interlock-controlled doors into an area

* By design, inner door will not unlock if outer door is open, or vice versa

* Usually, authentication required to enter second door

* Can be used to prevent piggybacking or tailgating

* Main goal is to identify and authenticate personnel

* Provide creds like license or passport

* Can include biometrics

* CCTV and intercoms common

* Security guard and bullet-proof glass

### Faraday cages and bag

* Block EMI, carrignton events, solar flares, and EMP

* Constructed from continuous covering of conductive material, or mesh of similar materials

* Often found in data centers & enterprise safe rooms

* Can be used for removable drives, cold storage cybercurrency wallets, and other critical components

### Air Gap

* Secure system with no access to internet

* May be disconnected from any network

* Physical or logical separation (private vlan)

* Still vulnerable to rogue insiders

* Stuxnet infiltrated air-gapped network

* Often used in:

    * Military & gov't agency 

    * Financial systems like stock & exchanges

    * ICS systems like SCADA in industrial facilities

    * Life-critical systems - nuclear power plants, aviation computers, medical systems

## **Fire Prevention, Detection, and Suppression**

### Fire controls

* Three aspects to fire control: 

    * Prevention

        * Fire-rated construction materials, training, and safety

        * Preparation

    * Detection

        * Smoke and fire detectors, sensors

        * Control quickly, minimize damage

    * Suppression

        * Contain & extinguish

### Suppression

* Create barriers

    * firewalls to prevent spread

* Portable fire extinguishers

    * Located in strategic places 

* Automatic water sprinkler systems

    * Common but cause water damanage, and can worsen electrical fire

* Halo substitutes or carbon dioxide discharge systems

    * Common around computer & network equipment

### Types of Extinguishers

* Type A: Common combustables using water, water mist, or soda acid

* Type B: Comustable liquids (petroleum products, coolants) - using halocarbons, inert gas, carbon dioxide, dry powders, or soda acids

* Type C: Electrical equipment & wires - inert gas, dry powders, powdered aerosols, foam, or carbon dioxide

* Type D: Combustable metals using dry powder only
